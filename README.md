### 🧠 Learning Notes
This project helped me understand how to:
- Create a Java GUI using Swing components  
- Add menus and buttons with ActionListeners  
- Save data to a text file  
- Use classes and interfaces to organize code  
- Write simple unit tests in Java  

I also got help from **ChatGPT** to understand how to connect the buttons and menu items and fix some small issues in my code.
